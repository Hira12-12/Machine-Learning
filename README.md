üìä Supervised Learning Models
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that predict outcomes.
This repository contains the following models:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression
Predicts continuous outcomes using a linear relationship between features and target.
Concepts learned: regression line, RMSE, R¬≤ score

2Ô∏è‚É£ Polynomial Regression
Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships
Concepts learned: polynomial features, overfitting/underfitting

3Ô∏è‚É£ Multivariate Regression
Regression using multiple input features
Concepts learned: coefficient interpretation, multiple feature analysis

4Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression
Classification model for binary or multiclass problems
Concepts learned: sigmoid function, probability prediction, confusion matrix

5Ô∏è‚É£ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Classification and regression using the nearest neighbors
Concepts learned: distance metrics, choosing K, model evaluation

6Ô∏è‚É£ Naive Bayes
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes‚Äô theorem
Concepts learned: conditional probability, handling categorical features

üìä Unsupervised Learning Models
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns or groupings.

1Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering

Groups data points into clusters

Concepts learned: centroids, inertia, elbow method, cluster visualization

2Ô∏è‚É£ Hierarchical Clustering

Builds nested clusters visualized in a dendrogram

Concepts learned: linkage methods, hierarchical relationships

3Ô∏è‚É£ DBSCAN

Density-based clustering that identifies outliers

Concepts learned: eps, min_samples, cluster labeling

4Ô∏è‚É£ PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Reduces dimensionality of data while retaining variance

Concepts learned: eigenvectors, explained variance, feature reduction

5Ô∏è‚É£ KNN (Unsupervised)

Using KNN to find neighbors for clustering or anomaly detection

7Ô∏è‚É£ Ensemble Learning
Combines multiple models to improve performance (Random Forest, AdaBoost, etc.)
Concepts learned: bagging, boosting, model aggregation


‚öôÔ∏è General Workflow

For each model, the workflow includes:

Load dataset

Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis)

Preprocess data (scaling, encoding)

Split data into training and testing sets (for supervised learning)

Train model(s)

Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, RMSE, R¬≤, clustering plots, etc.)

Visualize results

Draw insights from model outcomes

Key Learnings
